# Radiocast Station Guidelines

Welcome to Radiocast! Our guidelines are established to ensure that our platform remains a safe, welcoming, and friendly environment for all users. These policies are designed to protect our community and maintain a high standard of content quality. All station owners are required to adhere to the following guidelines. Non-compliance may result in penalties, including suspension or deletion of your station.

## Section A: Restrictions on Obscenities

To foster an inclusive and respectful community, the following rules apply regarding explicit or offensive content:

  * **Consequences:** Stations flagged as explicit may face restrictions on monetization and limited audience reach.

* **Prohibited Offensive Content**

  * **No Overly Aggressive or Offensive Material:** Content that most reasonable people would classify as overly aggressive or offensive is strictly prohibited.

  * **Examples:** Use of racially derogatory language (e.g., the N-word with the -er ending) or other hate-inciting terminology is not allowed.

  * **Definition:** Any content that promotes hate, discrimination, or violence against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other characteristic will be considered hate speech.

  * **Enforcement:** Such content will be immediately removed, and repeated or egregious violations may lead to permanent station suspension or deletion.

* **Additional Content Standards**
